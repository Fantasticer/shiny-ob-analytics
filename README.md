__shiny-obAnalytics__ is an experimental tool/demo developed using the 
[shiny](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny) web application framework for R.
The tool demonstrates use of 
[obAnalytics](https://github.com/phil8192/ob-analytics) - an R package created 
to visualise and explore 
[limit order book](http://parasec.net/transmission/order-book-visualisation/) 
data. 


## Included data
The data is based on 8 days of limit order book events obtained from the 
bitstamp (bitcoin) exchange between 2015-08-18 and 2015-08-25 and has been 
preprocessed with [obAnalytics](https://github.com/phil8192/ob-analytics). 

The time period covers a substantial depreciation (-24% over 7 days) and a 
significant market crash (-12% in < 30 minutes.) 


## Quick guide

The purpose of the tool is to be able to _zoom in_ to specific periods in time
and explore/visualise various aspects of market microstructure. 

The interface is divided into 2 sections: The left-hand-side, containing the 
time period, price and volume filters, and the right-hand-side containing a 
number of tabs, each of which are described briefly below. 

More detailed information can be found in the 
[obAnalytics](https://github.com/phil8192/ob-analytics) repository.

### Order book
!["order book"](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phil8192/shiny-ob-analytics/master/screens/order-book.png "order book")

The first tab describes the limit order book for a specific point in time. 

The graph in the top panel shows the cumulative volume on each side of the order 
book (blue = bid, red = ask) along with an indication of the largest 99% 
quantile orders. The actual limit order book is shown below the graph, limited
to +-100 BPS in depth.

### Price level volume
!["price level volume"](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phil8192/shiny-ob-analytics/master/screens/price-level-volume.png "price level volume") 

The price level volume graph shows the amount of volume available at each price
level in the order book through time. 

The graph has been colour coded such that lower quantities of volume appear in 
blue, whilst higher amounts of volume appear red. Since volume size is 
exponentially distributed, the interface provides an option to weight the colour 
coding or use a logarithmic scale.

### Depth percentiles
!["depth percentiles"](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phil8192/shiny-ob-analytics/master/screens/depth-percentiles.png "depth percentiles")

The depth percentile plot is shown below the price level volume graph. It shows
the amount of volume available in +- 25 BPS increments above and below the best
bid and ask through time. It is intended to depict market _liquidity_.

### Order events
!["order events"](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phil8192/shiny-ob-analytics/master/screens/order-events.png "order events")

The order events tab shows the point in time at which limit orders are added or
removed from the order book. 

Here, red points correspond to ask side orders, whilst blue correspond to bids. 
An opaque circle corresponds to an _add_ event, whilst transparent corresponds 
to an order cancellation. The size of the point is determined by the amount of 
volume. The graph is intended to show identifiable systematic activity.

### Cancellations
!["cancellations"](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phil8192/shiny-ob-analytics/master/screens/cancellations.png "cancellations")

The cancellation tab shows volume cancellation through time. 

Each point (red = ask, blue = bid) corresponds to a cancelled limit order 
(y-axis = volume). The intention of the graph is to identify the behaviour of 
individual market participants.

### Trades and events
!["events"](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phil8192/shiny-ob-analytics/master/screens/events.png "events")

In addition to visualisation, the interface includes an interactive 
[DataTables](https://github.com/DataTables/DataTables) view of trade and 
individual limit order events (add, update, delete). 

### Filtering

All of the above graphs and tables may be filtered by time, price and volume. 

If not specified, the tool will try to automatically determine the price and 
volume range based on the distribution of events. 

For convenience, price and volume histograms are shown to help determine the 
filtering range.
